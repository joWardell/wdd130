    <h2>Jody</h2>
    <p>Wanting a couple of certificates I realized that with some effort I could get a second bachelor of science degree
        in Professional Studies. I am an older, non-traditional student therefore taking my time to pursue additional
        interests.</p>

    <p>Last year, my husband retired from the USAF after 36 years on active duty. He now works for <a
            href="https://www.jacobs.com/"><b>Jacobs</b></a> and we live in
        Sierra Vista, Arizona. We have a black lab who 12 years old (Janie Belle) and a chihua-chow who is 4 years old
        (Jasper), and recently rescued another chihuahua mix who is 18 months old (Juliet Buttercup) from Palominas.</p>

    <p>A fun, local discovery we made last year is the <a href="https://www.doublegalpacasaz.com/"><b> Double G Alpaca
                Ranch.</b></a> Leroy German works for <b>Jacobs</b> and we met him
        and his wife, Paula, at a company picnic. They have prize winning alpaca fiber and they offer a fabulous HipCamp
        site:

                Alpaca My Bags.</b></a></p>

    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is <a
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.32,35?lang=eng&clang=eng#p#32"><b>
                Nephi 11:32,35-36.</b></a></p>
