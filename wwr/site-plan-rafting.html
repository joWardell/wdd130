    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This program is structured to teach the basics of rafting in a safe,
        encouraging environment for children ages 5-10 years old. We go over
        terminology, rules, safety, and equipment. We participate in fun
        activities that encourage skills, boost confidence, and being active in working as part
        of a team.</p>
     
    <!-- My idea is a combination of thoughts taken from the following sites and individuals:

        3. Southeastern Expeditions: https://southeasternexpeditions.com/skills-white-water-rafting-teaches/ -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This program is perfect for Parents, married or single, Grandparents, or
        or Guardians looking to give their child(ren) a fabulous summer time
        adventure. It is especially great for children who need to gain confidence
        in expanding their inner resources while building health habits and learning to focus. </p>
