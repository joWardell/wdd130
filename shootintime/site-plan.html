      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>As a woman, I appreciate the luxury of a whole packaged shooting experience, everything from having a first class pro shop to a variety of course offerings, and, especially, an on site gunsmith. </p>
     
      <p> A professionally designed website to communicate your safe, controlled environment, especially targeting women, will definitely enhance your range attendance. Remember, we are the fastest-growing demographic in the gun-ownership population.</p>
<p>By the way, how do you currently keep track of registrations for events and courses? How helpful will it be to have an online registration process to track clients, events, and shooting lane reservations?</p>  
<p>As a Web Designer, I will help your business communicate and attract customers by helping them feel the vibe of your Indoor Shooting Range and encourage them to stop in or book online. After all, we all want to conveniently hone our marksmanship skills without having to four-wheel out to the desert.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Shootin’ Time Indoor Range offers a local, air conditioned alternative to the thirty minute jaunt <br>
        to the closest open range. This is a fabulous opportunity to encourage increased active participation<br>
        for women and men who do not have the time or the vehicles to rough out the terrain to keep up with <br>
        weapons training.</p>

        <p>Mothers, women, especially working women, will greatly benefit from Shootin’ Time Indoor Range as it is<br>
        within 15 minutes travel time from most locations in the city. We will plan specific Ladies Classes along <br>
        with Couples Nights to encourage team participation and a family bonding experiences. </p>  <!-- change this -->
